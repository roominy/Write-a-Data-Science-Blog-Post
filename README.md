## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBnB dataset from Kaggle to better understand:
1. What is the best time to visit Seattle (peak seasons, listings prices)?
2. What are the number of Airbnb listings in Seattle neighborhoods and the listings rate price?
3. Which Airbnb Seattle listings properties have the greatest impact on their prices?


## 3. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
 
Seattle AirBnB Listings Analysis.ipynb contains the Python code for this project. 



## 4. Results <a name="results"></a>

The findings of the anslysis can be found at my post [here](https://medium.com/@roominy/a-simple-guide-to-airbnb-in-seattle-data-science-approach-fd6c8d8c8a4d).
